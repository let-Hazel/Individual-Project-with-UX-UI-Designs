    <br />
    <p> Carrier Wave by Robert Brockway is an amazing horror, apocolyptic novel where you and the multiple main characters live through a step-by-step descent into a zombie-not-zombie apocolypse. Everytime i watch "Bird Cage" i am transported into this book, but make no mistake, Carrier Wave came first.</p>

    <br />
    <p>Devil Venerable Also Wants To Know by Cyan Wings is like scratching an itch you didn't even know you had only to never be able to find it again. All the characters where fully developed, popular tropes where turned upsid-down. Devil Venerable Also Wants To Know tells the same story but in three different genres, and oh is it fun to connect those genres.</p>

    <br />
    <p>Fallen By Lauren Kate, the epic romance between Luce and Daniel. Their love story spans centuries, with moments of tender intimacy, heart-wrenching separation, and ultimate devotion. I have known love and i will never have it. </p>

    <br />
    <p>The Return By Camille Funk is a book that feels to me, to be about a doomed existance. Ellie was born to lose, spend infinite lifetimes never reaching the age of 18, and living those 17 human years fearing a death she knows will certainly come.</p>

    <p>The Mirror Of Ecidyrue By Starbrigid is a harry potter fanfiction written in the pov of Draco Malfoy. This is a time travel story that retells the whole Harry Potter books in Draco's pov but with foreknowledge. I did not expect to be blown away when i read the fanfiction, i did not expect greek mythology, i did not expect the world-building, i did not expect to be wowed.</p>
